# golden-era-of-videogames-SQL
This is a project from Datacamp, although, the complete data can be retreived also from Kaggle. You can see the project in my Datacamp profile https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/cc5c9584-6203-451a-923f-3c2dda453d71/edit
The aim of this project was to practice the techniques used for Exploratory data analysis (EDA) in postgre-SQL. 
Other tools, such as jupyter-notebooks were used.
Here there is a list of the questions answered and the SQL techniques intended to be practiced:
  1. The 10 best selling videogames of all times (usen ORDER BY clauses and LIMIT)
  2. Missign review scores (identify NaN values and work with LEFT JOINs)
  3. Years loved by game critics (INNER JOIN)
  4. Was 198 eally that great (INNER JOIN and HAVING+COUNT())
  5. Years that dropped of the critics favourite list (WHERE + NOT IN + nested subqueries)
  6. Years videogame players loved (HAVING + COUNT())
  7. Years that both, players and critics loved (nested queries)
  8. Sales in the best video games years (WHERE+IN(list))
